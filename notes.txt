---------------------------------

Layout desgin by using float
By using only 10 properties
1. width

3. border
4. background-color
5. float : right, left
6. font-size / font-family
7. margin / padding

================================================================================
background
----------------------
1. background-color:
--------------------------
1. by providing direct color name
2. by using hexadecimal color codes --> we create 16lac color codes
3. by using rgba values

The background-color has one drawback you use only one color at a time.
But my requirement is i want to use multiple color at a same time.



2. background-image:
---------------------------------
1. To take the image on UI.
2. To use multiple colors at a same time in css we use inbuilt function called as 
    linear-gradient()

Synatx:
---------------
linear-gradient(direction, colors)
direction --> to right, to left, to bottom, to top and you can also pass degree.



Position:
----------------------
By default all html element are in static nature.
Suppose i want to move static element there are two possiblites 
a) by using padding and margin.
b) by using position property

We can move the element by using some css poperties such as,
1. top
2. right
3. left
4. bottom
5. z-index



1. absolute --> variable
2. relative --> constant
3. fixed
4. sticky
5. static --> by default all html element has default position as a static.



display:
--------------------------------
1. display: block , inline, inline-block, flex, grid, table, list

Q. What is mean by flex?
------------------------------------
Flex is nothing but it is magic box in which the html element automatically expand
when you add some element into it or automatically shrink when delete some element
from box.

There is one drawback of flex, flex can work on only one direction at a time.
That is either in row direction or in column direction.

Terms
--------------
flex-container
flex-items

when you use display:flex than all the elements arranged in row direction.

You dont need use float properties.


Q. What are the different properties of flex?

                    c) end 
                    d) space-between
                    e) space-around
                    f) space-evenally


5. align-items : Basically this property can work on vertical direction.
                    a) start
